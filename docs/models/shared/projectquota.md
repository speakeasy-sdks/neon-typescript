# ProjectQuota

Per-project consumption quota. If quota is exceeded, then all active computes
will be automatically suspended and it won't be possible to start them neither
with API method call or with incoming proxy connections. The only exception is
`logical_size_bytes`, which is applied on per-branch basis, i.e. only compute
on the branch with `logical_size` exceeding quota will be suspended.

Quotas are enforced based on per-project consumption metrics with the same names,
which are reset at the end of each billing period (first day of the month).
Logical size is also an exception here, as it represents the total size of data
stored in some branch, so it's not reset.

Zero quota value or empty mean 'unlimited'.
